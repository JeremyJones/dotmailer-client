This is a SOAP client which interacts with the dotmailer.co.uk API system.

To use this system to interact with your dotmailer account, first ensure that you have created an API user and have a note of the new username and password.

Then set your username and password in the sample file dotmailersupport.sample.py and save that file as dotmailersupport.py so that the SOAP client can use it.

You can then run the script and (currently) use it to query a particular user, to list the campaigns in your account, or to retrieve lists of email addresses which have bounced after attempting to send a message.

Full implementation of all methods is not (yet) available through this package.
