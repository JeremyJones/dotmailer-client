This is a SOAP client which interacts with the dotmailer.co.uk API
system.

-----------------
Prerequisites
-----------------

  - Python (tested version is 2.6.5, other versions may work)

  - Suds (0.3.9) provides the SOAP client. Suds is available for
    download at https://fedorahosted.org/suds/

  - Django (1.2) is required for the simplejson package, which is used
    to translate the SOAP responses into JSON format for output. 
    Django is available at www.djangoproject.com

-----------------
Installation
-----------------

To use this system to interact with your dotmailer account, first
ensure that you have created an API user and have a note of the new
username and password.

Then set your username and password in the sample file
dotmailerauth.sample.py and save that file as dotmailerauth.py so that
the client can use it.

You can then run the script and (currently) use it to query a
particular user, to list the campaigns in your account, or to retrieve
lists of email addresses which have bounced after attempting to send a
message.

-----------------
Notes
-----------------

Full implementation of all methods is not (yet) available through this
package.
